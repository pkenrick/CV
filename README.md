## Profile

I am a former Chartered Accountant about to begin my true career as a full stack web developer.  As a recent graduate from the respected Makers Academy in London, I am hungry for more knowledge.  I would love to join a team from which I can continue to build my development skills, and where I might be given the opportunity to contribute towards exciting projects.  

My recently acquired development skills are supported by 10 years of experience in finance and banking industry, where I developed my project management, problem solving, and communication skills, along with a knowledge of financial/accounting systems, financial products and taxation.

As a British-born Kiwi (born in Southport, UK but raised and educated in New Zealand), I was first bitten by the coding bug at Auckland University when, while undertaking my business degree, I was able to perform the first year of a computer science degree.  I did not have the opportunity to continue my computer science studies at the time, but never forgot how much I enjoyed the technical papers (primarily coding in Java).  Numerous times in the years since I attempted to teach myself further (via online Java and Python courses), but with a busy job and little free time to practice, I did not progress.  At the beginning of 2016 I left my job in finance to pursue my development career.

## Skills

#### Communication

Ability to communicate ideas clearly and concisely, both written and verbal, to a diverse range of audiences including students, peers, clients, and senior management. These include presentations to small and large audiences.  Past examples:
  - presenting tax initiatives to Deloitte's tax department;
  - training sessions for graduates;
  - leading internal/client meetings;
  - holding meetings with non-native english speakers (colleagues and clients) while at PKF in Thailand.

#### Project Management

My experience (in particular at Morgan Stanley) was heavily project based, allowing me to develop:
  - people, project and resource management skills;
  - ability to drive problem solving initiatives in a group.

I anticipate the ability to self manage (project components, time and resources) will be hugely important for a junior developer.

#### Independent Learning

My time at Morgan Stanley and at PKF International required jumping into the deep end, resulting in:
 - an enjoyment of self-learning
 - ability to seek out necessary resources to assist my learning (bet they books online materials, or other people in the firm with the knowledge I need);
 - knowing the limits below which self-learning is useful (sometimes asking for assistance is the most efficient solution for the team as a whole).
