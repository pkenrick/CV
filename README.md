## Paul Kenrick

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

As a recent graduate of the highly regarded Makers Academy in London, I am a junior full stack web developer.  I hope to join a team of talented developers where I might be given the opportunity to contribute towards exciting projects, while learning all I can in order to grow.  My recently acquired skills are supported by project management, problem solving, and communication skills gained through 10 years of experience in finance and banking, as a Chartered Accountant.

##Profile

I was first bitten by the coding bug at university when, while undertaking my business degree, I was able to perform the first year of a computer science degree.  I did not have the opportunity to continue my computer science studies at the time, but never forgot how much I enjoyed the technical papers (mostly coding in Java).  Numerous times in the years since I attempted to further teach myself (mainly Java and Python), but with a busy job and little free time to practice, it was difficult.  At the beginning of 2016 I left my job in finance to pursue by development career.
