## Paul Kenrick

As a recent graduate of the highly regarded Makers Academy in London, I am a junior full stack web developer.  I would love to join a team of talented developers from whom I can continue to learn and grow, and where I might be given the opportunity to contribute towards exciting projects.  My recently acquired skills are supported by project management, problem solving, and communication skills gained through 10 years of experience in finance and banking, as a Chartered Accountant.

As a British-born Kiwi (born in Southport, UK but raised and educated in New Zealand), I was first bitten by the coding bug at Auckland University when, while undertaking my business degree, I was able to perform the first year of a computer science degree.  I did not have the opportunity to continue my computer science studies at the time, but never forgot how much I enjoyed the technical papers (mostly coding in Java).  Numerous times in the years since I attempted to teach myself further (mainly Java and Python), but with a busy job and little free time to practice, it was difficult to progress.  At the beginning of 2016 I left my job in finance to pursue my development career.

## Skills

#### Communication

My experience has allowed me to communicate ideas clearly and concisely, both written and verbal, to a diverse range of audiences including students, peers, clients, and senior management.  I have had many opportunities to make presentations to small and large audiences and am confident doing so.  Examples of such opportunities include:

- Deloitte - writing and making regular presentations to tax department on current tax issues, leading training sessions for graduate consultants, leading both internal and client meetings;
- Morgan Stanley - leading both local and global conference call discussions to communicate or gather information on current projects.
- PKF International - holding meetings and conference calls with with non-native English-speakers required very clear and concise communication skills.

#### Project Management

My experience (in particular at Morgan Stanley) was heavily project based, which required me to develop people, project and resource management skills, and the ability to drive problem solving initiatives.  During my time at Morgan Stanley my team implemented a large liquidity reporting project requiring input from all parts of the business, and people situated in cities across the UK, Europe and the US.  Such skills will be very useful in a development environment, and as a junior developer, for simply managing my own resources and task components.

#### Independent Learning

My time at Morgan Stanley and at PKF International required jumping into the deep end.  As I result I have developed an ability (and even an enjoyment of) self-learning, and seeking out necessary resources to assist my learning, along with the ability to pick up this knowledge quickly. These resources could be online materials, or other people in the firm with the knowledge I need.  I feel I have also learned the limits below which self-learning is useful, as opposed to when asking for assistance is the most efficient solution for the team as a whole.  My time at Makers has further strengthened these skills and has taught me to apply them to my new discipline.
